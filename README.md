As of now, I’m just playing around with nbdev. But the problem I’m
trying to solve is that while I can set `hyphens: auto;` in CSS, many
browsers do a poor job of hyphenating Finnish. Even if they have Finnish
hyphenation patterns, they often fail to recognise compound words, which
should be hyphenated at compound boundaries (saippua-kauppias, not
saip-pua-kaup-pias). One solution is to set `hyphens: manual;` and add
soft hyphens at acceptable hyphenation spots.

## Install

``` sh
pip install https://github.com/jkseppan/shyster/
```

## How to use

Fill me in please! Don’t forget code examples:

    from .file import read_patterns
    from .pattern import convert_patterns
    from .hyphenation import hyphenator
    pp, ex = read_patterns(open('/Users/jks/Downloads/hyph-fi.tex').readlines())
    ppr, ppm = convert_patterns(pp)
    ex = convert_exceptions(ex)
