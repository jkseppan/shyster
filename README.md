As of now, I’m just playing around with nbdev. But the problem I’m
trying to solve is that while I can set `hyphens: auto;` in CSS, many
browsers do a poor job of hyphenating Finnish. Even if they have Finnish
hyphenation patterns, they often fail to recognise compound words, which
should be hyphenated at compound boundaries (saippua-kauppias, not
saip-pua-kaup-pias). One solution is to set `hyphens: manual;` and add
soft hyphens at acceptable hyphenation spots.
